# express-mongo-backend

Express, Mongo and Typescript are a powerful combination. This is a starting point to save you some time setting them up.

## Installation
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fadamakis/express-typescript-backend`
* Change into the project directory: `cd repository`
* Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
The project provides several scripts that can be executed using npm. Here is a brief description of each script:

* `dev`: Starts the server using nodemon, which automatically restarts the server when changes are detected.
* `build`: Compiles the TypeScript files into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (tsc).
* `start`: Runs the server in production mode using ts-node, which allows running TypeScript files without precompilation.
